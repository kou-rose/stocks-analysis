# Stocks Project with VBA
## Overview of Project
After providing Steve with a means to analyze his dataset of stocks at the click of a button, he would now like to expand that analysis to safely include thousands of stocks in the stock market opposed to dozens. To that end, my intention is to take the code already being used, and refactor it in hopes of making it more efficient.

## Results
The results of my attempt at refactoring were mixed. First of all, the refactored code was supposed to run faster than the original code. My did not, as shown below, where we have the refactored code on the left and the original on the right.

Rather, my refactored code ended up running roughly .2 seconds slower than the original code.
